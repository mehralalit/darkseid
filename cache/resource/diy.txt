Implement a key value store, with following requirements in mind:
1. Must support concurrent read/write operations
2. Must persist data on the disk
3. Maximize the read/write throughput
Implement it as a library with following interface:
interface KVStore<K, V> {
V get (K key);
void put (K key, V value);
void delete (K key);
void clear ();
long size ();
}

Feel free to use any web resource, but mention it clearly and also do not use any off-
the-shelf solution.
